 The popularization of virtual reality has created a visual revolution that radically changes both our perception of images and our relationship to reality. Virtual spaces create illusionary worlds that can be directly experienced. Viewers immerse themselves in impressions as far away as possible from the outside world, thereby becoming physically involved through interactive elements that resemble their body. Through virtual reality, the audience becomes part of an image that fills their entire field of vision.

 Technologies suitable for mass consumption, such as VR glasses, 3D cardboards, 3D projectors and televisions, are increasingly found in everyday life. The various fields of application for these technologies, including 3D-supported operation monitoring, video games, trauma coping and the digitization of lost cultural treasures all illustrate how virtual spatial images already influence different areas of our world and will continue to shape our future.

  In a society that relies on technological innovation to fuel everyday life, museums and exhibitions like this are necessary to start the discussions relevant to the concerns of our digital age. In a field which is just beginning to take the art world by storm, this is a first insight into the revolution virtual reality will have on the perception and creation of contemporary art.
