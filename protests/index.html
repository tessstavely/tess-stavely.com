          <br><br>
          WHY PROTEST? <br> <br>
          1. PEOPLE REALISE THEY ARE NOT ALONE<br><BR>
          One way in which the establishment maintains its power is by creating a dominant discourse from which dissidents’ views are excluded. If people think differently, they may feel isolated, marginalised and powerless. Public demonstrations and marches empower people by showing them that there are thousands of people who think the same things.
          <br> <br>
           2. BY PROTESTING, WE ALTER THE AGENDA AND START A DEBATE <br><BR>
           Those in power may try to ignore us, but if there are enough protesters then they will feel the need to come up with reasons why all of the protesters are wrong. That is when the debate begins and argument becomes possible.
           <br><br>
           3. IT PROVIDES AN ESSENTIAL VOICE FOR MINORITY GROUPS<br><BR>
           The classic theorists of representational government recognised that universal suffrage and majority voting threaten to impose the ‘tyranny of the majority’ and override the rights of minorities. Protests are a vital corrective to majority rule.
           <br><br>
           4. SOMETIMES WE WIN!<br><BR>
           If there are enough protesters, the policies of those in power may become unworkable. When the UK government introduce the flat-rate Poll Tax in 1990, huge numbers of people protested and refused to pay the tax. It became clear that prosecuting everyone who refused would be impossible, chaos threatened, and the government abolished the tax.
           <br> <br>
           5. SOMETIMES WE WIN IN WAYS WE HAD NOT INTENDED OR PLANNED <BR><br>
           Political events are unpredictable. The protests against nuclear cruise missiles at Greenham Common in the UK in the 1980s appeared to have failed when the missiles were installed, but the protests had forced the US and UK governments into saying that they had to deploy the missiles only because the Soviet Union was doing the same. When Mikhail Gorbachev came to power in the Soviet Union and said that he was willing to make an agreement to withdraw all the missiles, the Western governments could not go back on what they had said. The missiles were withdrawn, and Greenham Common is now public parkland.
           <br><br>
           6. SOMETIMES WE WIN BUT IT TAKES A GENERATION OR MORE <BR><br>
           At the time it may feel that it's going nowhere; that those in power are stuck in a certain mindset and cannot change their thinking. But then a new generation may come along, unencumbered by past thinking, and see that the views of the protesters were just common sense. Think of the huge turnaround in attitudes to gay people over a couple of generations.

HOW TO MAKE A SIGN THAT ISNT TRASH <br><br>

CONTENT<br> <br>
The content of a protest sign is absolutely crucial. Not only should it have a concise message, but it also needs to deliver the tone to passers-by. <br><br>

READABILITY<br><br>
Sketch out what your message is going to look like on your sign. The number of words should be kept to a minimum in order to keep your statement concise and allow for plenty of room for large letters. <br><br>The font of the text needs to be both bold and large, and presented in such a way that your sign can be read from a distance.<br><br>

COLOUR <br><br>
Certain colors specifically pair well together when trying to get someone’s attention. Consider “complementary” or “opposite” colors, that make each other stand out. <br><br>One way to effectively pick colors is to mimic the schemes of road signs and other learned attention-grabbing indicators: emphasizing white-on-red, black-on-yellow, and black-on-orange are all likely to catch the eyes of passers-by. <br><br>

MATERIALS<br><br>
If you are expecting your protest to receive any form of media attention, having a double sided sign is much more effective in conveying your message. Consider using foam core sheets, poster board or cardboard from old boxes that is free and easy to carry.<br>
